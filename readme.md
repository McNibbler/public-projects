# IMPORTANT NOTICE

This repository will no longer be updated as of today 4/27/2018. The reason for this is because I have since split up all my projects among their own individual repositories for the sake of organization and accessibility.
While I will still keep this repo up for archival purposes, I have no intentions of contributing to it any more and will instead update with each project's respective repo.

## Where can I find the new repos?

There were a number of useful projects in here and they are still available and being updated elsewhere.

- The biggest project that I've been working on (my ATE STDF processor) can be found [here](https://github.com/McNibbler/ATE-Data-Reader).

- The numerous simulation tools I've made in R are now [here](https://github.com/McNibbler/R-Simulations). (I may even break this up into more repositories if it ever becomes too large)

- My MATLAB multi-stage signal analyzer will now be updated [here](https://github.com/McNibbler/Multi-Stage-Signal-Analyzer).

- My Arduino code for controlling the AD5722/AD5732/AD5752 DACs are now [here](https://github.com/McNibbler/DAC-Controller). (Notice 6/8/2018: this has since evolved into a much more expansive multi-device controller framework )

There are a couple projects in here that have not made it to their own repository, notably something like "First Project" in Python or "test.go", but I feel like these really are not particularly important, and don't need to be transferred.
These will still remain here for archival purposes, yet again.

Anyways, thank you for taking a look at my page! This was not supposed to become as big as it has, and it's exciting that it even got to the point where I needed to branch out. I hope something of here will be of use to you or at the very least something interesting!

If you have any questions, don't be afraid to find me and contact me! Thank you again!

## Old readme

These are some of my projects from work at Xcerra that were used for learning rather than for working on any intillectual property.
