A useful MATLAB script for taking input and output sine wave signal data in the time domain and process it. This script will take the FFT of your data, both linearly (with real, imaginary, and absolute parts) and in decibels. It will calculate the THD of your signal, show the gain between the two stages and compare them, as well as phase-correcting the data. It can even calculate the exact residual distortion at each frequency resulting from the distortion in the transfer function between the two stages.

NOTE: This MATLAB project is a simplified version of an analyzing tool I created for analyzing different stages of a proprietary circuit board I designed.

This version of the tool has been stripped of all referrences of any intillectual property at Xcerra and is updated at my liesure.

At this moment in time, the tool is not up to date with the current private version.
