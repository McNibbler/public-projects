# The purpose of this program is to attempt to make sense of Teradyne's somewhat-standard fie format: the              #
# Standard Test Data Format (STDF). This proprietary file format consists of non-trivially parsed and encoded          #
# binary data and is the most commonly used format of data produced by Automatic Test Equipment (ATE), used by         #
# companies like LTX-Credence and Teradyne. This program will be using the obscure but very helpful PySTDF library     #
# to parse and subsequently process the data into sensible, meaningful results.                                        #
#                                                                                                                      #

# I also want to apologize in advance for some stupid code; e.g when I was creating arrays and I did something like:   #
#                                                                                                                      #
# np.zeros(...)                                                                                                        #
# SOME CODE TO DO SOMETHING TO THE ARRAY                                                                               #
# np.delete(... , 0, 0)                                                                                                #
#                                                                                                                      #
# I get this is really stupid, but frankly I haven't used python (or numpy at all) for anything like this in years and #
# I really can't be bothered to figure out the "proper" way to initialize and append to numpy arrays so this is my     #
# lazy solution and it works well enough for now so I don't really care if it looks stupid. Maybe I'll fix it later.   #
# It does not help that, going into this project, I had absolutely 0 experience with this file format and did not even #
# know what the end results were actually supposed to look like. Given that knowledge, please don't beat me up too     #
# badly for my messy and disorganized code. Thank you again and have mercy on me please :)                             #

# NOTE: Do not run this program on data with the a file of the same name, but with "_parsed.txt" or "_excel.xlsx"      #
# appended to the end; e.g. running this on "data.std" with a file called "data.std_parsed.txt" in the same folder is  #
# a bad idea, as it will be overwritten, due to the fact that this program creates and writes to a text file of that   #
# naming convention. But for real, why would you even do that in the first place?                                      #
