# The purpose of this program is to attempt to make sense of Teradyne's de-facto standard fie format: the              #
# Standard Test Data Format (STDF). This proprietary file format consists of non-trivially parsed and encoded          #
# binary data and is the most commonly used format of data produced by Automatic Test Equipment (ATE), used by         #
# companies like LTX-Credence and Teradyne. This program will be using the obscure but very helpful PySTDF library     #
# to parse and subsequently process the data into sensible, meaningful results.                                        #
#                                                                                                                      #

# This is the part where I apologize for having some likely extremely jank code. For a while, this project used some   #
# horrible combination of numpy and python's normal arrays because I didn't really remember what I was doing, due to   #
# not using python much like this for a long time. That has since been cleaned up, but I know as a fact that there's   #
# still plenty of horrible things in my code and it's probably disgustingly organized, but just bear with me. Maybe if #
# I at all knew what I was supposed to do when I started this, it would have worked out better, but for now we're just #
# gonna roll with it. Have mercy on me :)                                                                              #

# NOTE: Do not run this program on data with the a file of the same name, but with "_parsed.txt" or "_excel.xlsx" or   #
# "_results.pdf" appended to the end; e.g. running this on "data.std" with a file called "data.std_parsed.txt" in the  #
# same folder is a bad idea, as it will be overwritten, due to the fact that this program creates and writes to a text #
# file of that naming convention. But for real, why would you even do that in the first place?                         #

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Parsed text file structure explanation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
# The PySTDF library parses the data really non-intuitively,        #
#   although it can be viewed somewhat more clearly if you use the  #
#   toExcel() function (I recommend doing this for figuring out the #
#   way the file is formatted). Basically, each '|' separates the   #
#   information in columns, and the first column determines the     #
#   "page" you are dealing with. The only ones I found particularly #
#   useful were SDR (for the number of sites) and PTR (where all    #
#   the data is actually contained).                                #
# The way the PTR data is parsed is very non-intuitive still, with  #
#   the data broken into chunks num_of_sites lines long, meaning    #
#   each chunk of num_of_sites lines contain a corresponding        #
#   test_tuple that can be extracted, as well as a data point       #
#   result for each test site. This is then done for every single   #
#   test_tuple combination. After all that is done, the process is  #
#   repeated for every single run of the test, creating a new data  #
#   point for each site in each test tuple for however many numbers #
#   of tests there are.                                             #
# It's very not obvious at first, so I strongly recommend creating  #
#   an excel file first to look at it yourself and reverse-engineer #
#   it like I did if you really want to try and figure out the file #
#   format yourself. I'm sorry the library sucks but I didn't       #
#   design it :/ . Good luck!                                       #
